Hi,

Someone has requested adding the following e-mail address and SSH public
key to the public database at http://sshkeys.net/:

   E-mail:         {{ email_address }}
   Public key:

{{ sshkey }}

To confirm this is correct, go to:

http://sshkeys.net/confirm/{{ confirmation_key }}/ 

If this is not correct, *do not click on the link above*.

Thanks,

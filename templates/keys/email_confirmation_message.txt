Hi,

Someone has requested adding the following e-mail address and SSH public
key to the public database at http://sshkeys.net/:

   E-mail:      {{ email_address }}
   Public key:  {{ sshkey }}

To confirm this is correct, go to:

http://sshkeys.net/confirm/{{ confirmation_key }}/ 

If this is not correct, you can either do nothing or let me know by 
replying to this mail.
